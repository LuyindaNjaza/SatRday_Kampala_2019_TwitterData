# Hello Twitter

In line with classical *Hello world!* lines in most programming languages, this folder provides a introduction and code of how to retrieve twitter data using *Python* (011 Python) and *R* (012 R) and their dedicated libraries/packages. While in particular *Python* code is usefull for retrieving extensive twitter dataset using a something like and rasperry pi, the *R* code can easily used to retrieve small samples.

While the *python* script primarly presents how to retrieve data, the *R* -- using the *rtweet* -- provides an brief overview of the package building on the [documentation](https://rtweet.info) and [presentation](https://mkearney.github.io/nicar_tworkshop/#1) by author and maintainer [Michael W. Kearney](https://mikewk.com/about/).
